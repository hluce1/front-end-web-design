               <h4>Introduction</h4>
               <p>
                  The Tocumwal Archive is a collection of stories and photographs, about living in the houses that were moved from the Tocumwal 
                  air force base in New South Wales, to the Canberra suburb of O'Connor. The base was built during the Second World War as an inland 
                  defence against Japanese invasion. As camouflage, the sleeping quarters for air force personnel were built in the form of houses. 
                  After the War, the acute housing shortage in Canberra gave the houses a new purpose. From the late 1940s, about 200 of them were 
                  transported to the growing suburbs of Ainslie and O'Connor. In O'Connor they were located in two groups of four cul-de-sacs meeting
                  at a central park and bounded by Macarthur, Macpherson, Miller and Tate Streets. 
               </P>
               <p>
                  The area is listed as an Australian Capital Territory (ACT) heritage precinct. Collection for the Archive began in 1996 with a 
                  PhotoAccess project supported by the ACT Heritage Council. Stories and photographs are archived according to the donor's name. 
                  Ongoing community collection and maintenance of the Archive is encouraged. The Archive is open for research use and the contribution
                  of material at the ACT Heritage Library in the Woden Town Library.

               <h4>Heritage Listing</h4>
               <p>The Tocumwal Housing Precinct in O'Connor is significant as an outstanding example of low cost pre-fabricated housing, which was constructed in Canberra after World War 2.
                  As part of the Government's solution to the critical housing shortage being experienced in Canberra at the time, many of the houses originally constructed at Tocumwal
                  in NSW for the US Army Air Corps were re-erected in the ACT. The cottages are of distinctive design types and limited geographically to the O'Connor Precinct and a small area in Ainslie.
                  The Precinct remains the most intact example of this style of housing and is unique in Canberra for its urban planning, landscaping and social history.

               <h4>The Origins of Canberra's Tocumwal Houses</h4>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     After the bombing of Darwin, the United States and Australia made joint plans for Australian inland defence. 
                     The Tocumwal airfield was the largest and first of several large airfields planned for construction in relation to the the 
                     line of possible Japanese advance. It was built by the Australian Government (Australian Civil Construction Corps and Allied Works Council) 
                     on behalf of the United States Army Air Force between February and April 1942. (2000,Dr Darryl McIntyre and Noel Flanagan)

                     My family was aware of Tocumwal and its houses long before they became a feature of the streets of O'Connor. My father, Hartley Hollier, was 
                     a serving member of the RAAF from 1936-46 and was actually stationed at Tocumwal when the 'Tocumwal houses' were in that town, 
                     newly-built and functioning as they had been designed to function. 
                     I imagine there was at first a feeling of, <i>'What on earth are we going to do with all this lot?'</i> But, concurrently, 
                     Canberra was developing fast by the mid-1940s and someone had the brilliant idea (or so it would seem, 
                     with hindsight) of bringing the houses and re-erecting them here. Sylvia Hollier. (contributed 1996)

                     Like many others Stanley Mawston (Bluey) Forster went to join up in 1942. Because of his building qualifications 
                     and ability to read plans - blueprints as they were referred to in those days - he was seconded to the Dept of the Interior. 
                     His was to be a different kind of war. Stan arrived in Tocumwal by train with troops and personnel like himself, late one Saturday afternoon. 
                     Stan had bought the house that he and his family moved into in 1964 and spent his spare time renovating it with the view of 
                     moving it into town to retire in. After the completion and refit he chose to sell and return to Wollongong and the family home 
                     they had left behind twenty seven years before. Judy Carlon, Tocumwal Historical Society. (contributed 1996)

               <h4>Recounts</h4>
               <p>
                  In the mid-1990s the Tocumwal houses precinct in O'Connor was nominated for listing on the ACT Heritage Register 
                  and is now a listed heritage precinct. Most of the remaining government houses have been sold and land values have increased considerably. 
                  People moving into the area often have an interest in the distinctive architectural features of the houses and their restoration. 
                  The Tocumwal houses are weatherboard to sill height, AC sheet fibro above with small timber framed windows of two to four vertical panes.
                  Roofs are hipped and sheeted with corrugated iron. They have large lounge rooms, typically with double doors opening into the dining room, 
                  generous verandahs and red brick chimneys. As a result of private owernship, some of the houses were dramatically modified prior to heritage 
                  listing, but the streetscape view remains fairly consistent. Typically the houses have either three or four bedrooms. A small number, in Quinn, 
                  Peel and Macpherson streets, have two bedrooms. These did not come from Tocumwal but were built as look-alikes to complete the precinct by the government's 
                  workforce, rather than by Jim Perry. (Information from The O'Connor precinct design criteria, prepared by ACT Public Works for ACT Housing Trust, 
                  George Lewis - an original Tocumwal resident, and member of the government day labour force)
